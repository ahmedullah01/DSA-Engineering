# 📘 DSA-Engineering (Semester 3)

A collection of all **lab work**, **assignments**, and **practice files** for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course — Semester 3.

This repository contains implementations and solutions for common DSA topics using C / C++.

---

## 📌 Contents

The project includes a variety of data structure and algorithm programs such as:

### 📁 Data Structures
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack
- BST (Binary Search Tree)
- Hashing
- Open Hashing

### 📁 Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

### 📁 Labs & Assignments
- Lab 01: Searching Algorithms
- Lab 02: Linked List
- Lab 03: Hashing
- More core DSA lab exercises

Each folder typically contains the implementation, and sometimes sample input/output for practice.
