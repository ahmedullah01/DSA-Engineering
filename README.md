# DSA-Engineering – Semester 3

This repository contains all **lab work files and assignments** for the
**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course of **Semester 3**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is created to:

* Store **all DSA lab work**
* Practice **core data structure concepts**
* Serve as a reference for **exams and revisions**

---

## 📁 Lab Structure

### 🔹 Lab 1: Searching Algorithms

This lab covers basic searching techniques:

* **Linear Search**

  * Searches an element sequentially
  * Simple and easy to understand
* **Binary Search**

  * Works on sorted data
  * Faster than linear search
* **Occurrence Count**

  * Counts how many times a given element appears in the data

📌 Concepts covered:

* Comparison-based searching
* Practical use cases

---

### 🔹 Lab 2: Linked List

This lab focuses on **Singly Linked List** implementation.

Implemented methods:

* `insert()` → Insert a new node into the list
* `delete()` → Remove a node by value
* `search()` → Find an element in the list
* `display()` → Print all elements of the list

📌 Concepts covered:

* Dynamic memory allocation
* Pointers and node traversal
* List manipulation operations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* C / C++
* Basic DSA concepts
* Console-based programs
